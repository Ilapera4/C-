Homework 7


1. What is wrong with the code and how would you fix it?
        #ifndef PROJECTILE_H
        #define PROJECTILE_H
        Class Projectile {
        private:
                double position;
                double speed;


        public:
                Projectile(double speed, double velocity);
                virtual ~Projectile();


                double getSpeed() const;
                double getVelocity() cont;


        }; //end of projectile class


        What is wrong with this code is that it doesn’t have a semicolon after the closing curly bracket.  To fix this, add a semicolon to the end of the code before the comment.




2. What is wrong with the following code and how to fix it?


        Projectile(int speed, int velocity){
                this.x = x;
                this->x = x;
                this.y = y;
                this->y = y;
        }


        What is wrong with this code is that they are using the wrong “this” method.  It should be “this->x = x” which returns a pointer.


3. Describe each:
   1. int* method(int* arg): a method that takes an pointer as an argument and returns a pointer
   2. Const int* method(int* arg): a method that takes a pointer as an argument and returns a const pointer
   3. Const int* const method(int* arg): a const method that takes a pointer as an argument and returns a const pointer
   4. Const int* const method(const int* arg): a const method that takes a const pointer as an argument  and returns a const pointer
   5. Const int* const method(const int* arg) const:
4. In what ways are C++ strings better that C strings and vice versa?
        C++ strings are better in the way that they are much safer, and easier to use.  Also they support different string manipulation functions.  C strings are better than C++ strings in the way that C strings don’t limit you to C++, also C is a part of many common APIs.
5. Difference between a pointer and a reference?
        The difference is that a pointer can be NULL, while a reference cannot be NULL.  Another difference is that a reference is automatically dereferenced, and a pointer is not.
6. What is a destructor used for?
        The destructor is used to delete heap memory that has been allocated by the class
7. Write an angle class...?
		I was unable to completly understand how the overloading operators function, so I will study up on it somemore and try to complete this assignment.
