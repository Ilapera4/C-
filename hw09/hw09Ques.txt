1. The difference between upcasting and downcasting is that upcasting is going from an object to a supertype and downcasting
is casting to a subtype.

2. You would mark a method as virtual in order to override that method.  If you don't mark it as virtual, then others will not
be able to override the method.

3.The difference between dynamic and static cast is that static cast is at compile time while dynamic cast is at runtime.  You
would use one over the other depending on what you are casting.  For example, you would use dynamic cast when you're casting from
a base class to a derived class.

4. You would use a const cast when something isn't going to be changed.

5.The difference is that in the one with the const cast, the class Fruit isn't going to be changed by the method.

6. In java there are interfaces while in C++, a class can inherit from more that one superclass.
