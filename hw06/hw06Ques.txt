1. What are libraries good for?
   1. Libraries are good for reusing functions so that the one coding doesn’t have to keep rewriting the same functions for different codes
1. What are the two types of libraries, and how are they different?
   1. The two types of libraries are Static and Shared Object.  They are different because Shared libraries are .s files and are used at run-time, while Shared Libraries are .a files and are used at compile time.
1. I made almost no progress with the code. I don’t fully understand how to use the PPM array to write JPEG.
